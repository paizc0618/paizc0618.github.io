            <h2>Computers</h2>
              <p1>I spend a lot of time working with computers. I currently create different things in programs such as
                  photoshop, after effects, illustrator, Cinema4D, etc. In Photoshop and Illustrator, I create logos and
                  company rebrands, banners, etc. In After Effects, I work on video creation and I am going to lean more
                  about animation. And in Cinema4D, I create 3D models and 3D scenes, but I do this less often because of
                  how CPU instensive it is. I also play games on my computer in my freetime with some of my friends. I 
                  also sometimes work on building computers for my friends, family or myself.</p1>
           <br>
             <h2>Golf</h2>
               <p2>I also play golf in my freetime. I have been golfing since I was about 5 years old, but I didn't start
                   playing regularly until my middle school years. I made the team at CCA both Freshmen and Sophomore year
                   and I am hoping to return to the team this spring as a Junior. Golf is something that has become very
                   relaxing and enjoyable whether I go out by myself with some music, or I go with my family members or 
                   friends.
