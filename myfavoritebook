            <h2>No Country For Old Men Summary</h2>
            <h3><i>By Cormac McCarthy</i></h3>
            <p1>Cormac McCarthy's novel, <i>No Country For Old Men</i> follows a man named Llewelyn Moss as he escapes
            a man named Anton Chigurh. While out hunting, Moss stumbles upon an extremely graphic crime scene. Dead bodies
            were scattered on the ground and trucks were riddled with bullet holes. Inside one of the cars was a load of cash
            that belonged to a mexican drug lord. Moss, who takes the money, soon found himself in pursuit by Anton Chigurh who
            was sent out to recover the money. The story mainly follows the lives of Chigurh and Moss. The predator and the prey.
            The hunter and the hunted. <i>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Country_for_Old_Men">No Country For Old Men Wiki Page</a>)</i>
            <h2>No Country For Old Men Review</h2>
            <p1>This is my favorite novel because of the intriguing story that grasps the reader with incredible details. In
            the opening scene of the book, Moss' hunt is so well described that the reader can visualize the entire open landscape
            that he settled on for his shooting. Another aspect of the book that interested me was the writing style. There was
            a lot of slang and was written in a way that Moss himself would write. Very little sophistication stuck to the words
            on the page would pulls the reader closer to who Moss was. The combination of the author's writing style and the sheer
            carnage of the characters' actions made this one of my favorite books to read.
